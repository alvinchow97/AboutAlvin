    <string name="desc_name">Hi, my name is Alvin
    I love Fish
    The kind is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river,
    or a lake, and  definitely the ocean
    Fun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
    I like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish
    not so much. And sometimes I even go fishing. And even less sometimes, I actually
    catch somethings, I actually catch something.
    Once, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon
    with my hands.
    I\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium. You should ask someone else about
    fishing though.</string>
